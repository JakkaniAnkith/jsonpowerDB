**Student Enrollment System Using JsonPowerDB**

The Student Enrollment System is an application designed to automate the process of student data entry, updating, and management. The system uses JsonPowerDB, a real-time, high-performance database built on JSON that allows the storage and retrieval of student information efficiently. The application allows users to add new student records, update existing records, and retrieve information based on specific queries (like roll number). With a focus on simplicity, speed, and scalability, this project provides a seamless solution for student data management.
